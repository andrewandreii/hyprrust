# Hyprrust

A rust library for communicating with the Hyprland sockets.

While there are other crates that are used to communicate with the Hyprland sockets, this one might stand out because of:
 - Events are received through async channels
 - Ability to connect to as many hyprland sockets as you want
 - Ability to implement your own Hyprland commands
 - Batching commands

This library hasn't released yet.
